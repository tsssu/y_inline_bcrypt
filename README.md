# y_inline_bcrypt
i hate things when got overcomplicated, so this provide basic level (single plugin) thing for those who got error.

## Why?
Why? try yourself include y_bcrypt or whatever, thanks to that shit thirdpartyplugin stuff that is included in y_bcrypt, now things broke.
Maybe for me? i guess so.

## Installation
Use your favourite whatever man just download .inc is that hard to do?

Oh and don't forget to use [this bcrypt plugin](https://github.com/Sreyas-Sreelal/samp-bcrypt/releases/latest)

## Usage
Same as y_inline_bcrypt.inc
